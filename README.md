  My program, haven't figured out why yet, doesn't subtract correctly. When I test 0x46 - 0x08 it continues to output 0x2C. 
  The other issue I'm having relates to the B Functionality. I am not sure how to jump back from the maxValue or         negativevalue functions to where I was in the program.
