## Lab 1 for Intro to Embedded Computer Systems

#### Debugging/Difficulties
  My program, haven't figured out why yet, doesn't subtract correctly. When I test 0x46 - 0x08 it continues to output 0x2C. 
  The other issue I'm having relates to the B Functionality. I am not sure how to jump back from the maxValue or         negativeValue functions to where I was in the program. Also, I'm still confused on how to multiply in CCS and/or assembly code. With those exceptions the program works!
